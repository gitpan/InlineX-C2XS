- 0.09 ... Rewrite the t_makefile_pl test script. (It's now not a very
           conclusive test ... still needs further work ... though I think
           the WRITE_MAKEFILE_PL functionality is operating correctly.)
           Add coverage (currently untested) for the CC, LD, and MAKE options. 
           TODO: Add coverage for BOOT, CCFLAGS, FILTERS, LDDLFLAGS,
           MYEXTLIB, OPTIMIZE and PREFIX options.

- 0.08 ... Rename the module into the InlineX namespace (previously named
           Inline::C2XS)
           Add coverage for VERSION, LIBS, BUILD_NOISY and
           WRITE_MAKEFILE_PL options.

- 0.07 ... Add coverage for AUTOWRAP, TYPEMAPS, INC and AUTO_INCLUDE.
           The cpp2xs() function is no longer supported by this module.
           Use Inline::CPP2XS instead.

- 0.06 ... Add a demos/cpp folder with a CPP demo.

- 0.05 ... Add Inline::CPP to XS support with the cpp2xs() function.

- 0.04 ... Now hooks into the Inline::C routines that parse the code and write
           the XS file.
           The c2xs() sub now takes an optional 3rd argument (the directory
           into which the XS file gets written).
